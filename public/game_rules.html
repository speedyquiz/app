<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3"><strong>Timed Gameplay:</strong></p>

<ul class="ul1">

<ul class="ul1">

<li class="li3">Each quiz game has a predetermined time limit for answering questions, typically ranging from 60 to 90 seconds.</li>

<li class="li3">In the event of unanswered questions, they will be marked as incorrect.</li>

<li class="li3">All players competing in the same &ldquo;quiz&rdquo; will have the same amount of time to answer the questions and complete the game.</li>

<li class="li3">There may be a latency between devices of multiple players, so start times may vary slightly.</li>

<li class="li3">Once confirmed to play, the player will be notified via a countdown and then a 5 second period to initiate play.</li>

</ul>

</ul>

<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3"><strong>Competition and Prizes:</strong></p>

<ul class="ul1">

<ul class="ul1">

<li class="li3">Players compete against each other in real-time to achieve the highest score within the shortest time.</li>

<li class="li3">Prizes are awarded to player(s) who achieve the maximum score of 100% in the shortest time.</li>

<ul class="ul1">

<ul class="ul1">

<li class="li3">Cheating, use of external aids, or any form of unfair practices are strictly prohibited.</li>

<li class="li3">The quiz app employs measures to detect and prevent cheating, including but not limited to, time-stamping responses, randomizing question orders, and monitoring player activity.</li>

<li class="li3">Any attempts to manipulate the game or exploit vulnerabilities will result in disqualification and potential legal action.</li>

</ul>

</ul>

<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">NOTE: Each quiz game is designed to challenge all players / competitors, so time allocated to complete the quiz is commensurate with perceived difficulty and actual physicality. Hence SPEEDQUIZZ will not allow a Player / Competitor to achieve an overall &ldquo;Winner Status&rdquo; if the game is completed with 100% correct answers in a time sooner than 30% of the allocated time &ndash; example: A game is completed with 10/10 questions correct in 15 seconds. This is designed to eliminate &ldquo;Bashers&rdquo; who are Players that just flick through each question without reading or observing the images and just pushing any answer option to complete the game in the fastest time.</p>

<p class="p3">NOTE 2: The odds of getting 100% correct are huge. This is a question in one of our quizzes</p>
